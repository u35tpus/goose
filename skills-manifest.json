      "content": "\nThis skill teaches effective use of **beads** (`bd`), a distributed git-backed issue tracker designed for AI agents. Use beads to track tasks, manage dependencies, and coordinate work across sessions.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nFirst, check if beads is available and initialized:\n\n```bash\n# Check if bd is installed\nbd version\n\n# Check if current project has beads initialized\nbd status\n```\n\n**If `bd` is not installed**, ask the user which installation method they prefer:\n- **npm:** `npm install -g @beads/bd`\n- **Homebrew:** `brew install beads` (macOS)\n- **Go:** `go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest`\n\nDo not install without user confirmation, as these are global system packages.\n\n**If not initialized in the project**, run:\n```bash\nbd init\n```\n\nFor personal use on shared projects (won't commit to repo):\n```bash\nbd init --stealth\n```\n\nFor contributors on forked repos (routes to separate planning repo):\n```bash\nbd init --contributor\n```\n\n## Essential Commands\n\n| Command | Purpose |\n|---------|---------|\n| `bd ready` | List tasks with no open blockers (what to work on next) |\n| `bd create \"Title\" -p 1` | Create a task (priority 0-3, lower = higher priority) |\n| `bd show <id>` | View task details and dependencies |\n| `bd list` | List all open issues |\n| `bd close <id>` | Mark task as complete |\n| `bd update <id> --status in_progress` | Update task status |\n| `bd dep add <child> <parent>` | Create dependency (child blocked by parent) |\n| `bd sync` | Force immediate sync to git |\n\n**Always use `--json` flag** for machine-readable output when parsing results.\n\n## Task Hierarchy\n\nBeads supports hierarchical IDs for organizing work:\n\n- `bd-a3f8` — Epic (large feature)\n- `bd-a3f8.1` — Task under epic\n- `bd-a3f8.1.1` — Sub-task\n\nCreate hierarchical tasks:\n```bash\nbd create \"Epic: User Authentication\" -t epic -p 1\nbd create \"Implement login flow\" -p 1 --parent bd-a3f8\n```\n\n## Session Workflow\n\n### Starting a Session\n\n```bash\n# See what's ready to work on\nbd ready --json\n\n# Pick a task and mark it in progress\nbd update <id> --status in_progress\n\n# View full details\nbd show <id> --json\n```\n\n### During Work\n\n```bash\n# Create new tasks as you discover them\nbd create \"Fix edge case in validation\" -p 2\n\n# Add dependencies\nbd dep add <new-task> <blocking-task>\n\n# Update task with notes\nbd update <id> --notes \"Found issue with timezone handling\"\n```\n\n### Ending a Session (\"Land the Plane\")\n\nWhen finishing work, complete ALL these steps:\n\n```bash\n# 1. File issues for remaining work\nbd create \"TODO: Add integration tests\" -p 2\n\n# 2. Close completed tasks\nbd close <id> --reason \"Completed\"\n\n# 3. Sync and push (MANDATORY)\ngit pull --rebase\nbd sync\ngit push\n\n# 4. Verify push succeeded\ngit status  # Must show \"up to date with origin\"\n\n# 5. Identify next task for follow-up\nbd ready --json\n```\n\n**CRITICAL**: Always push before ending a session. Unpushed work causes coordination problems in multi-agent workflows.\n\n## Important Rules\n\n### DO use `bd update` with flags\n```bash\nbd update <id> --description \"new description\"\nbd update <id> --title \"new title\"  \nbd update <id> --design \"design notes\"\nbd update <id> --notes \"additional notes\"\nbd update <id> --acceptance \"acceptance criteria\"\nbd update <id> --status in_progress\n```\n\n### DO NOT use `bd edit`\nThe `edit` command opens an interactive editor (`$EDITOR`) which AI agents cannot use. Always use `bd update` with flags instead.\n\n### DO sync before ending sessions\n```bash\nbd sync  # Forces immediate export, commit, and push\n```\n\nWithout `bd sync`, changes sit in a 30-second debounce window and may not be committed.\n\n### DO include issue IDs in commit messages\n```bash\ngit commit -m \"Fix auth validation bug (bd-abc)\"\n```\n\nThis enables `bd doctor` to detect orphaned issues.\n\n## Dependency Types\n\n```bash\n# Hard blocker - child cannot start until parent is done\nbd dep add <child> <parent> --type blocks\n\n# Soft link - related but not blocking  \nbd dep add <issue1> <issue2> --type related\n\n# Parent-child - hierarchical relationship\nbd dep add <child> <parent> --type parent-child\n```\n\n## Handling Merge Conflicts\n\nIf conflicts occur in `.beads/issues.jsonl`:\n\n```bash\n# Accept remote version\ngit checkout --theirs .beads/issues.jsonl\n\n# Re-import to database\nbd import -i .beads/issues.jsonl\n\n# Continue with your work\n```\n\n## Git Hooks (Recommended)\n\nInstall hooks for automatic sync:\n\n```bash\nbd hooks install\n```\n\nThis prevents stale JSONL problems by auto-syncing on commit, merge, push, and checkout.\n\n## MCP Server Alternative\n\nFor tighter integration, beads also offers an MCP server (`beads-mcp`) that provides tools directly to your agent. Install via:\n\n```bash\npip install beads-mcp\n```\n\nThe CLI (`bd`) and MCP server work with the same underlying database.\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n```bash\n# What should I work on?\nbd ready\n\n# Create a task\nbd create \"Fix bug in login\" -p 1\n\n# Start working\nbd update bd-xyz --status in_progress\n\n# Done working\nbd close bd-xyz --reason \"Completed\"\nbd sync\ngit push\n```\n",

Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.\n\nThe user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.\n\n## Design Thinking\n\nBefore coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:\n- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?\n- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.\n- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).\n- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?\n\n**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.\n\nThen implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:\n- Production-grade and functional\n- Visually striking and memorable\n- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view\n- Meticulously refined in every detail\n\n## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines\n\nFocus on:\n- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.\n- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.\n- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.\n- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.\n- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.\n\nNEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.\n\nInterpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.\n\nRemember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.\n",

      "content": "\n# Goose Blog Post\n\nWrite blog posts for the [block/goose](https://github.com/block/goose) open source project blog powered by Docusaurus.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- The goose repo must be cloned locally\n- Locate the blog directory at `<goose-repo>/documentation/blog/`\n- Confirm the `authors.yml` and blog directory exist before proceeding\n\nIf the repo is not cloned, clone it:\n\n```bash\ngh repo clone block/goose\n```\n\n## Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Writing Mode\n\nAsk the user how they want to work. There are three modes:\n\n1. **\"I have a draft\"** — The author has written (or will write) their own content. The agent scaffolds the directory, frontmatter, and image setup, then places the author's content into the correct format and reviews it against blog conventions.\n\n2. **\"I have notes/an outline\"** — The author has rough ideas, bullet points, or an outline. The agent expands these into a full draft while preserving the author's voice and key points. Present the draft for the author's review before finalizing.\n\n3. **\"Write it for me\"** — The author provides a topic and key points. The agent writes the full post. Present the draft for the author's review before finalizing.\n\n**Important:** For modes 1 and 2, the author's voice and intent take priority. Do not rewrite their content unnecessarily. Focus on structure, conventions, and polish — not on replacing their words.\n\n### Step 2: Gather the Blog Post Details\n\nAsk the user for the following (do not assume any of these):\n\n1. **Topic**: What is the blog post about?\n2. **Author**: Who is the author? (needs to match a key in `authors.yml`)\n3. **Target audience**: Who is this for? (developers, beginners, community, etc.)\n\nFor modes 2 and 3, also ask:\n4. **Key points**: What are the main things the post should cover?\n5. **Tone**: Technical deep-dive, casual walkthrough, announcement, etc.?\n\nFor mode 1, ask:\n4. **Where is the draft?** A file path, or ask them to paste it in.\n\n### Step 3: Verify Author Exists\n\nCheck `<goose-repo>/documentation/blog/authors.yml` for the author key.\n\nIf the author does **not** exist, create a new entry. The format is:\n\n```yaml\nauthorkey:\n  name: Full Name\n  title: Job Title\n  image_url: https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/<github-id>?v=4\n  page: true\n  socials:\n    github: github-username\n    x: x-username\n    linkedin: linkedin-username\n```\n\nAsk the user for any missing details (name, title, GitHub username, social handles). The `image_url` can be derived from their GitHub profile: `https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/<id>?v=4`. Look up their GitHub user ID if needed:\n\n```bash\ngh api users/<username> --jq '.id'\n```\n\n### Step 4: Create the Blog Post Directory\n\nBlog posts use the naming convention:\n\n```\nYYYY-MM-DD-slug-title/\n  index.md\n  banner.png\n```\n\nRules:\n- Use **today's date** (run `date +%Y-%m-%d` to get it)\n- The slug should be lowercase, hyphen-separated, concise, and descriptive\n- The directory lives inside `<goose-repo>/documentation/blog/`\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p documentation/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug-title\n```\n\n### Step 5: Assemble the Blog Post\n\nCreate `index.md` inside the new directory. The file structure is:\n\n#### 1. Frontmatter\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: \"Your Blog Post Title\"\ndescription: \"A concise summary of the post (1-2 sentences). Used in social previews and SEO.\"\nauthors:\n  - authorkey\n---\n```\n\nFrontmatter rules:\n- `title` — wrap in quotes, use title case\n- `description` — wrap in quotes, keep to 1-2 sentences, make it compelling for social sharing\n- `authors` — a YAML list of author keys from `authors.yml` (supports multiple authors)\n- Do **not** include a `date` field — Docusaurus extracts the date from the directory name\n- Do **not** include `tags` in frontmatter — the blog does not use Docusaurus tags\n\n#### 2. Banner Image\n\nEvery post **must** include a banner image immediately after the frontmatter:\n\n```markdown\n![blog banner](banner.png)\n```\n\nBanner image requirements:\n- **Dimensions:** 1200×600 pixels\n- **Location:** Same directory as `index.md`\n- **Filename:** `banner.png` (or `.jpg`, `.webp`)\n- **This same image is also used for social sharing** (Open Graph / Twitter cards) — there is no separate social image\n\nIf the user does not have an image ready, add the image reference as a placeholder and remind them to add the file before publishing. You can also offer to generate one if image generation tools are available.\n\n#### 3. Introduction + Truncate Marker\n\nThe intro paragraph(s) appear before the truncate marker. This controls the preview on the blog index page:\n\n```markdown\n![blog banner](banner.png)\n\nYour compelling introduction paragraph that hooks the reader.\n\n<!--truncate-->\n```\n\nThe intro should:\n- Hook the reader — why should they care?\n- Be 1-3 paragraphs max\n- Give enough context to decide whether to click through\n\n#### 4. Content Body\n\n**For mode 1 (author's draft):** Place the author's content here. Adjust only what's needed to match the formatting conventions below. Flag any issues for the author rather than silently rewriting.\n\n**For modes 2 and 3:** Write the content following the guidelines below, then present the full draft to the author for review.\n\n**Formatting Conventions:**\n- Use `##` for major sections and `###` for subsections\n- Do **not** use `#` (h1) in the body — the title from frontmatter is the h1\n- Include code blocks with language identifiers (` ```python `, ` ```bash `, etc.)\n- Use bullet points and numbered lists to break up dense information\n- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences) for readability\n- End with a clear takeaway, call-to-action, or next steps\n\n**Voice & Style:**\n- Write in first person when sharing personal experience, third person for announcements\n- Be conversational but technically accurate\n- The goose blog audience is developers — respect their intelligence\n- Avoid marketing fluff; be genuine and specific\n- Use concrete examples and code snippets over abstract explanations\n\n**goose-Specific Conventions:**\n- Refer to the project as \"goose\" (lowercase) when referencing the tool\n- When linking to goose docs: `https://block.github.io/goose/`\n- When linking to the repo: `https://github.com/block/goose`\n- When linking to extensions: `https://block.github.io/goose/extensions`\n\n#### 5. Social Metadata (`<head>` Section) — Required\n\nEvery blog post **must** end with a `<head>` section containing Open Graph and Twitter card meta tags. This is placed at the very end of the `index.md` file, after all content:\n\n```html\n<head>\n  <meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"YOUR TITLE HERE\" />\n  <meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" />\n  <meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https://block.github.io/goose/blog/YYYY/MM/DD/slug-title\" />\n  <meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE\" />\n  <meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/BANNER_FILENAME_WITH_HASH.png\" />\n  <meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\" />\n  <meta property=\"twitter:domain\" content=\"block.github.io\" />\n  <meta name=\"twitter:title\" content=\"YOUR TITLE HERE\" />\n  <meta name=\"twitter:description\" content=\"YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE\" />\n  <meta name=\"twitter:image\" content=\"https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/BANNER_FILENAME_WITH_HASH.png\" />\n</head>\n```\n\n**Important:** The `og:image` and `twitter:image` URLs require a Docusaurus-generated filename that includes a content hash. You **cannot** guess this filename — it must be obtained from the local preview. See Step 6 for how to get it.\n\nField reference:\n- `og:title` / `twitter:title` — same as the frontmatter `title`\n- `og:description` / `twitter:description` — same as the frontmatter `description`\n- `og:url` — the production URL: `https://block.github.io/goose/blog/YYYY/MM/DD/slug-title`\n- `og:image` / `twitter:image` — the static image URL obtained from local preview (see Step 6)\n- `twitter:card` — always `summary_large_image`\n- `twitter:domain` — always `block.github.io`\n\nWhen first creating the post, use `https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/BANNER_FILENAME_WITH_HASH.png` as the placeholder for `og:image` and `twitter:image`. The `BANNER_FILENAME_WITH_HASH` portion will be replaced with the real filename after Step 6.\n\n### Step 6: Preview Locally and Get the Image URL\n\nThe author needs to preview the blog post locally to:\n1. Verify the post looks correct\n2. **Get the static image URL** needed for the `<head>` social metadata\n\nTell the user to run this in a **separate terminal** (do **not** run this command directly — it blocks the terminal):\n\n```bash\ncd <goose-repo>/documentation\nnpm start\n```\n\nThis starts a local dev server at `http://localhost:3000` with hot reloading.\n\nOnce the preview is running, instruct the user to:\n1. Navigate to their blog post in the browser\n2. Right-click the banner image → **Copy Image Address**\n3. The copied URL will be something like:\n   `http://localhost:3000/goose/assets/images/banner-a1b2c3d4e5f6.png`\n4. **Extract the filename** (e.g., `banner-a1b2c3d4e5f6.png`)\n5. Construct the production URL:\n   `https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/banner-a1b2c3d4e5f6.png`\n\nUpdate the `<head>` section's `og:image` and `twitter:image` with this production URL.\n\n### Step 7: Present the Draft for Review\n\n**This step is critical.** Before considering the post done:\n\n- Show the author the complete `index.md` content\n- Highlight any decisions you made (title wording, section structure, intro framing)\n- Ask if they want to adjust anything\n- For mode 1: call out any formatting changes you made and why\n\nIterate based on feedback until the author is satisfied.\n\n### Step 8: Final Review Checklist\n\nRun through this checklist and fix any issues:\n\n- [ ] Directory follows `YYYY-MM-DD-slug-title/` naming convention\n- [ ] `index.md` exists in the directory\n- [ ] Frontmatter includes `title`, `description`, and `authors`\n- [ ] Author key exists in `authors.yml`\n- [ ] Banner image (1200×600) is referenced after frontmatter\n- [ ] Banner image file exists in the directory (or flagged as needed)\n- [ ] `<!--truncate-->` marker is placed after the intro\n- [ ] No `#` (h1) headers in the body — only `##` and below\n- [ ] Code blocks have language identifiers\n- [ ] Links to goose resources use the correct URLs\n- [ ] `<head>` section is present at the end of the file\n- [ ] `og:image` and `twitter:image` URLs are filled in from local preview\n- [ ] Spelling and grammar are clean\n- [ ] Post reads well from start to finish\n\n## Content Types That Work Well\n\nWhen helping the author brainstorm or choose a direction, these formats tend to perform well on the goose blog:\n\n- **Tutorials and how-tos** — \"How I built X with goose\"\n- **Deep dives** — architecture, features, or design decisions\n- **Community spotlights** — contributor stories and use cases\n- **Comparisons** — goose vs. other tools, honest assessments\n- **Release announcements** — what's new and why it matters\n- **Tips and workflows** — power-user guides and productivity hacks\n- **Thought leadership** — opinions on AI agents, developer tools, open source\n\n## Example\n\nA complete blog post:\n\n````markdown\n---\ntitle: \"Building a Custom MCP Server for Your Team\"\ndescription: \"A step-by-step guide to creating a Model Context Protocol server that connects goose to your team's internal tools.\"\nauthors:\n  - ebony\n---\n\n![blog banner](banner.png)\n\nIf your team has internal tools that aren't covered by existing extensions, building a custom MCP server is easier than you think. In this post, I'll walk through how I built one for our team's deployment pipeline.\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\n## Why Build a Custom MCP Server?\n\ngoose connects to tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

If you want to learn more, check out the [MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) and the [goose extensions directory](https://block.github.io/goose/extensions).\n\n<head>\n  <meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Building a Custom MCP Server for Your Team\" />\n  <meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" />\n  <meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/07/01/custom-mcp-server\" />\n  <meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"A step-by-step guide to creating a Model Context Protocol server that connects goose to your team's internal tools.\" />\n  <meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/banner-a1b2c3d4e5f6.png\" />\n  <meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\" />\n  <meta property=\"twitter:domain\" content=\"block.github.io\" />\n  <meta name=\"twitter:title\" content=\"Building a Custom MCP Server for Your Team\" />\n  <meta name=\"twitter:description\" content=\"A step-by-step guide to creating a Model Context Protocol server that connects goose to your team's internal tools.\" />\n  <meta name=\"twitter:image\" content=\"https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/banner-a1b2c3d4e5f6.png\" />\n</head>\n````\n",

It combines two powerful dimensions:\n\n- **Horizontal Axis: Gas Town Stages** — Measures AI tool adoption maturity from basic chatbots to multi-agent orchestration\n- **Vertical Axis: DOK Levels** — Measures the cognitive complexity of prompts from simple recall to extended thinking\n\nThe intersection of these dimensions reveals growth opportunities and helps users maximize the value they extract from their AI tools.\n\n---\n\n## How to Use This Skill\n\n### Installation\n\nInstall the skill using the skills CLI:\n\n```bash\nnpx skills add https://github.com/block/agent-skills --skill rp-why\n```\n\nMake sure you have the built-in skills extension enabled in your agent (Goose, Claude Desktop, etc.).\n\n### Using Slash Commands\n\nOnce the skill is loaded, you can use slash commands directly in your conversation:\n\n```\nYou: /rp-why current\n```\n\nGoose will analyze your current session and provide:\n- Your Gas Town stage assessment\n- DOK distribution breakdown\n- Quadrant position\n- Growth nudges\n\n### Available Commands\n\n| Command | What It Does |\n|---------|--------------| \n| `/rp-why current` | Analyze the current session |\n| `/rp-why init` | Generate a baseline from your history |\n| `/rp-why compare` | Compare current session to baseline |\n\n### Alternative: Natural Language\n\nYou don't have to use slash commands. You can also just ask naturally:\n\n```\nYou: Analyze my AI collaboration patterns using the Gas Town DOK framework\nYou: What's my DOK distribution for this session?\nYou: How does this session compare to my baseline?\n```\n\nThe skill will recognize these requests and provide the same analysis.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- **End of session**: Run `/rp-why current` to reflect on your work\n- **Weekly**: Run `/rp-why compare` to track progress\n- **First time**: Run `/rp-why init` to establish your baseline\n\n---\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nMany AI practitioners face a hidden inefficiency: a mismatch between tool sophistication and task cognitive complexity.\n\n| Anti-Pattern | Impact |\n|--------------|--------|\n| Using powerful autonomous agents for simple \"what is X?\" queries | Unrealized potential |\n| Asking deep strategic questions through basic chatbot interfaces | Bottlenecked thinking |\n| No visibility into personal AI usage patterns | Stagnant growth |\n| No framework for intentional growth in AI collaboration skills | Missed opportunities |\n\nWithout measurement, there's no improvement. Users need a mirror to see their AI collaboration patterns clearly.\n\n---\n\n## The Framework\n\n### Yegge's 8 Gas Town Stages (AI Tool Adoption)\n\nFrom Steve Yegge's \"Welcome to Gas Town\" (January 2026):\n\n| Stage | Name | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| 8 | Full Gas Town | Complete AI-native development ecosystem |\n| 7 | Agentic Workflows | Automated pipelines with agent coordination |\n| 6 | Multi-Agent | Orchestrating multiple specialized agents |\n| 5 | CLI Single Agent, YOLO | Terminal-based autonomous agent (e.g., Goose) |\n| 4 | Chat IDE | Integrated chat in development environment |\n| 3 | Copilot | Using AI code completion, inline suggestions |\n| 2 | Curious | Experimenting with basic chatbots occasionally |\n| 1 | Observer | Watching and evaluating AI tools, not yet actively using |\n\n### Webb's DOK Levels (Cognitive Complexity)\n\nFrom Norman Webb's Depth of Knowledge framework (1997):\n\n| Level | Name | Description | Prompt Indicators |\n|-------|------|-------------|-------------------|\n| 4 | Extended Thinking | Complex investigation, multiple sessions | \"Research and synthesize...\", \"Create a framework...\", \"Investigate over time...\" |\n| 3 | Strategic Thinking | Reasoning, planning, analysis, synthesis | \"Design...\", \"Analyze...\", \"What if...\", \"Develop a strategy...\" |\n| 2 | Application | Apply concepts, make decisions, compare | \"How would you...\", \"Compare...\", \"Explain why...\" |\n| 1 | Recall | Facts, definitions, simple procedures | \"What is...\", \"List...\", \"Define...\" |\n\n### Integration Matrix (Stage × DOK)\n\nThe intersection creates six distinct zones:\n\n```\n              DOK 1        DOK 2         DOK 3          DOK 4\n            (Recall)   (Application) (Strategic)

|\n|------|-------------|--------|\n| **Frontier** | Pushing boundaries of both tool and cognition | Celebrate & Document |\n| **Thinking Ahead** | High cognitive work with basic tools | Upgrade tools |\n| **Growing** | Stretching into higher complexity, positive trajectory | Encourage |\n| **Expected** | Appropriate match of tool sophistication to task complexity | Maintain |\n| **Underutilizing** | Sophisticated tools for simpler tasks | Increase DOK |\n| **Overpowered** | Tools exceed task needs—opportunity to level up your questions | Realign |\n\n---\n\n## Commands\n\n### `/rp-why
